# Exercise 3: A non-trivial visualizer implementation

For a complex example of a musicplayer visualizer, I invite you to check out 
the [ext-mp-scenery](https://github.com/scorbo2/ext-mp-scenery) extension. 
This scenery makes good use of full-screen animation to present gently scrolling
landscape images with programmable "tour guides" that can pop up to provide
commentary on the current track or the current landscape! 

Full source code is of course included.
