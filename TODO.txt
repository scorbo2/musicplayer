The weird blank screen on visualizer startup still randomly happens
  - maybe a threading issue
  - maybe suspend drawing on the window for a split second after it comes up? I dunno, just a thought
100% cpu usage seen coming out of visualization
  - like, AFTER visualization. 
  - is something still running? some wonky thread run amok?
