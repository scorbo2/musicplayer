next() in full screen mode in single monitor setup kills visualizer because of focus lost.
log console window icon is the java default
add config options for pre-convert directory?
  - how would that work? 
  - if all files in the playlist are in the same dir, spin up a background thread to pre-convert all of them?
  - store them in temp in some kind of pre-cache dir?
  - eh, would that even help with load times? yeah, but at the expense of disk space
  - and what do you do if the playlist has files from all over
  - I guess your precache dir could have the same structure
    /tmp/MusicPlayerCache/some/dir/file1.wav
    /tmp/MusicPlayerCache/some/other/dir/file2.wav
  - the cache directory could be configurable, max cache size, so on
  - seems like a lot of work to get around the fact that our audio load sucks balls
Robot should maybe be a config option as it does literally move the mouse to 1,1 every minute
  - can we get the current mouse position and just wiggle it in place?
Would be nice if the playlist would scroll to keep the selected file in view... seems like it just doesn't right now
The weird blank screen on visualizer startup still randomly happens
  - maybe a threading issue
  - maybe suspend drawing on the window for a split second after it comes up? I dunno, just a thought
100% cpu usage seen coming out of visualization
  - like, AFTER visualization. 
  - is something still running? some wonky thread run amok?
