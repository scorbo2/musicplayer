Would be nice if the playlist would scroll to keep the selected file in view... seems like it just doesn't right now
The weird blank screen on visualizer startup still randomly happens
  - maybe a threading issue
  - maybe suspend drawing on the window for a split second after it comes up? I dunno, just a thought
100% cpu usage seen coming out of visualization
  - like, AFTER visualization. 
  - is something still running? some wonky thread run amok?
